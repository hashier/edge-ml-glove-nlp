# edge-ml-glove-nlp
This high-speed, low-footprint NLP (Natural Language Processing) EDGE-ML (Edge Machine Learning) JavaScript library can be used to enhance and derive more info from 'TensorFlow.js' (TensorFlow JavaScript) classification predictions. This is accomplished by applying GloVe-based NLP (Natural Language Processing) on the classification labels. The most frequently associated words of the top labels are gathered, matched, ranked and sorted. This is essentially an ML charades expert that deduces what the unidentified object is by using the top labels as word clues.
